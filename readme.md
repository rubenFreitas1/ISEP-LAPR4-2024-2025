# Project Shodrone

## 1. Description of the Project

Project Shodrone is an autonomous drone control and operation system designed for various applications, including security, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The project aims to develop a reliable and efficient platform for managing multiple drones simultaneously with minimal human intervention.
This project was developed in a SCRUM-based agile process over 3 sprints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java - Main application, servers

- C - Drone Simulator  (process/thread management)

- ANTLR4 - Grammar definition and parsing for templates

- TCP Sockets - Inter-server and client-server communication

- H2 Database - In-memory storage with JPA

- JPA - ORM + repository layer for data persistence


## üìå Best Practices and Design Highlights

- The project followed an iterative and incremental development model (SCRUM-based), with 3 sprints.
- Domain Modeling
- Applied *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles and layered design
- Concurrency in C: Advanced synchronization mechanisms implemented (semaphores, mutexes, condition variables).
- Encapsulation: Use of DTOs to isolate internal domain logic.
- ANTLR & Visitor pattern: Clean parsing and templating logic.
