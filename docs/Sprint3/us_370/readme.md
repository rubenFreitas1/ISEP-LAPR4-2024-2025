# US 370 - Analyse a proposal

## 1. Context

*This user story focuses on enabling customers to retrieve and analyze their proposals using a code or link they received. 
The access must be isolated from the internal data structures and ensure a safe read-only experience. This functionality 
lays the groundwork for future interactions, such as accepting or rejecting proposals, and ensures a smooth and professional customer experience.*

## 2. Requirements

**US370** As a Customer, I want to have access to a show proposal of mine. I received a link/code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- US370.1 The customer can not have access to the database.
- US370.2 The customer must communicate with the system through a network.

**Dependencies/References:**

*This user story depends on US310 because the show proposals must be created first.*
*This user story depends on US316 because the show proposals must be sent to the customer.*

**Forum Insight:**

* Still no questions related to this user story on forum.
