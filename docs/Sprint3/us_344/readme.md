# US 344 - Generation of a drone program

## 1. Context

*This user story introduces the ability to process a DSL input file describing a drone show and transform
it into an executable set of instructions for each individual drone. This ensures the Drone Tech can go 
from design to simulation without manually creating drone-level code, reducing error and increasing efficiency.*

## 2. Requirements

**US344** As a Drone Tech, I want the system to use the figure/show high-level description code to generate the
code of the drones to be used in the simulation/test.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- US344.1 The final output must include, for each drone, a sequential list of executable commands, in a format compatible with the simulator or testing framework


**Dependencies/References:**

*There is a dependency with US251, since this US is the creation of the figure/Show high-level description.*


**Forum Insight:**

* Still no questions related to this user story on forum.
