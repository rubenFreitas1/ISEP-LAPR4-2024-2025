# US 364 - Enforce step-by-step simulation synchronization

## 1. Context

*As a PO, I want the simulation engine to synchronize the simulation's step-by-step progression using semaphores, so that all drone processes and parent threads advance in lockstep through each simulation time step.*

## 2. Requirements

**US 364** As PO, I Want to enforce step-by-step simulation synchronization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- US364.1 Semaphores are used to control the progression of each simulation time step.

**Dependencies/References:**

*There is a dependency with US361, since it's necessary a simulation to take place.*


**Forum Insight:**

* Still no questions related to this user story on forum.

## 3. Integration/Demonstration
