# US 265 - Generate a simulation report

## 1. Context

* Shodrone ensures the safety and quality of all drone figures and shows through rigorous simulation and validation before deployment.
* So the system must produce a comprehensive simulation report. This report will summarize the drone execution outcomes, identify any collisions with corresponding timestamps and coordinates, and ultimately determine if the figure passed safety validation.

## 2. Requirements

**US265** - As a system user, I want to receive a summary of the simulation results so that I can determine if the figure is safe to use.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- US265.1 The system must generate a report and store it in a file.
- US265.2 The report should include the total number of drones and their execution status.
- US265.3 If collisions occur, the report must list timestamps and positions.
- US265.4 The report should indicate whether the figure passed or failed validation.

**Dependencies/References:**

* This user story depends on user story US261 because provides the foundational execution framework, including launching drone processes and managing communication
* This user story depends on user story US262 because ensures the system collects accurate position data from each drone.
* This user story depends on user story US263 because it enables the detection and logging of collisions, which are required entries in the final report.
* This user story depends on user story US264 because is crucial for the report’s integrity, especially in documenting exact timestamps of collisions and ensuring the figure’s validity is accurately assessed.

**Forum Insight:**

* Still no questions related to this user story on forum.
