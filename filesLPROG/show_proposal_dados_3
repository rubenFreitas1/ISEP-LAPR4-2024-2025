Show Proposal

Apple is a VIP client and Shodrone is pleased to submit for your consideration a proposal for the execution of an aerial show with drones, as described below.
Shodrone is a company that prioritizes safety, which is why it uses the most advanced AI technology to support the development of its shows, with all shows being previously and carefully tested/simulated with AI-Test© technology before being presented to the client.
In the link http://omeulink.com there is a video with a simulation of the proposed show.

With the application of AI-Test©, a Shodrone exclusive, we are confident in offering liability insurance in the amount of 100 for the show. Detailed show data is presented in the attachment.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

John Macarroni
CRM Manager
